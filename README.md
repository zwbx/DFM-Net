## Features
- High accuracy: Experiments on 6 public datasets demonstrate that the proposed DFM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared to non-light-weight model.
- High Speed: cost 140ms on CPU (Core i7-8700 CPU), which is 2.2Ã— faster than the prior fastest efficient model A2dele.
- Low model size: Without any general model compression technology (such as quantification, distillation), its model size is only 8.5Mb, which is 14.9% of the prior smallest model A2dele.
